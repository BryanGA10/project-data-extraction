## Project Description

### Web Scrappper

The goal was to get as many elements of the Star Wars databank as possible being focused on the elements name, description, affiliation, and location info.

### API

Through "Game Prices API" we will be able to get a list of video game prices from multiple websites, as well as the lowest price, URL, currency, and release date.


## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* Obtain data from an API using Python.
* Scrape and clean HTML from a web page using Python.
* The results are in two folders - one containing the tabular results of the API request and the other containing the results of  web page scrape.
* The code is in a Jupyter Notebook in both cases
