 Ahch-To Jedi Temple ,"The first temple of the Jedi Order sits atop Ahch-Toâ€™s sacred island, high above the surrounding sea. The temple has been worn away by wind and time, but a visitor will still find mosaics depicting the first Jedi and an ancient meditation ledge. This spot is where Rey takes her next steps into a larger world.",,,https://www.starwars.com/databank/ahch-to-jedi-temple
