 Nikto (Red) ,"The red Nikto (a.k.a. Kajain’sa’Nikto) were a humanoid alien species hailing from the planet Kintan, featuring coarse, scaly skin that was marked horns and spikes. Like the Kadas’sa’Nikto, or green-skinned Nikto, they were found from world to world; several were in the employ of Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine, and Ima-Gun Di was a notable Jedi Master during the final days of the Republic.",,,https://www.starwars.com/databank/nikto-red
