 Admiral Raddus ,"A gruff Mon Calamari officer, Raddus commands the rebel starfleet before the Battle of Yavin, working to knit a hodgepodge of ships into a military force and arrange the delivery of new capital ships to the Alliance. Raddus has little patience for the rebel councilâ€™s endless committee meetings. As he sees it, military muscle is the key to defeating the Empire, not stirring speeches.",,,https://www.starwars.com/databank/admiral-raddus
