 The Twins ,"Cousins to the late, great Jabba the Hutt, a pair of fraternal Huttese siblings, referred to simply as the Twins, have designs for the criminal empire they see as their birthright. Overcoming their limited mobility and obvious avarice by being carried aloft on enormous litters, they are ferried along the streets by a legion of devoted servants, including a drummer who announces their arrival and a gladiator who stands guard.
