 WED Treadwell Droid ,"WED Treadwell droids are found throughout the galaxy, serving as utility and repair droids. Treadwells come in a range of models, but all have a flat, treaded base, a spindly neck and a cluster of arms tipped with various tools. The Lars family used Treadwell droids on their Tatooine moisture farm for decades; Luke Skywalker was with a Treadwell repairing vaporators when he caught sight of the battle between Princess Leia’s blockade runner and Darth Vader’s Star Destroyer.",,,https://www.starwars.com/databank/wed-treadwell-droid
